The system consists of two specialized robots: a Retrieval Robot for precise object manipulation and a Transportation Robot for long-distance delivery. The workflow includes object detection, grasping, temporary storage, and automated unloading.\nMechanical Design \u0026amp; Innovation #1. Bio-inspired Mobility (Theo Jansen Linkage) #The Retrieval Robot utilizes a modified Theo Jansen linkage (Strandbeest) for its movement.\nOptimization: We extended the wheelbase to increase stability and create more space for the internal chassis. Involute Gear System: To prevent interference found in standard circular gears, we designed custom Involute Gears with a 35:25 gear ratio, ensuring constant velocity and higher load capacity. 2. SCARA Robotic Arm \u0026amp; Gripper #A 4-DOF SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) was implemented for its superior balance.\nPrecision: Driven by NEMA 17 stepper motors and A4988 drivers. Efficiency: The center-heavy design ensures the robot remains stable during rapid arm movements. 3. Transportation Unit (LEGO EV3 Platform) #The delivery phase is handled by a custom LEGO EV3 robot featuring:\nPID Control: Advanced line-following logic for smooth navigation. Automatic Tilting: A dual-motor tipping mechanism for depositing items into the target zone.
