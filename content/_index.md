### Hi, I’m **Tom**

I am an undergraduate student double majoring in **Mechanical Engineering** and **Computer Science**, focusing on building intelligent robotic systems.

My research interests lie in [Robotics](tags/robotics), [Computer Vision](/), and [High Performance Computing](/).

I enjoy tasting hand-brewed coffee in my free time{{< icon coffee >}}
I play tennis and badminton :tennis: :badminton:  
I am always looking for new places to explore.  
Dreaming of visiting all the corners of the world.

<!-- I enjoy developing systems that connect physics-based modeling with modern computational tools, enabling robots to understand and act in real-world environments. -->

Curious about my previous work?  
Visit the **[Projects Page]({{< ref "projects" >}})** to explore more.
